    the list of words to load

    take a while to finish.

def get_permutations(sequence):
    '''
    Enumerate all permutations of a given string

    sequence (string): an arbitrary string to permute. Assume that it is a
    non-empty string.  

    You MUST use recursion for this part. Non-recursive solutions will not be
    accepted.

    Returns: a list of all permutations of sequence

    Example:
    >>> get_permutations('abc')
    ['abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'bca', 'cab', 'cba']

    Note: depending on your implementation, you may return the permutations in
    a different order than what is listed here.

        vowels_permutation (string): a string containing a permutation of vowels (a, e, i, o, u)
        
        Creates a dictionary that can be used to apply a cipher to a letter.
        The dictionary maps every uppercase and lowercase letter to an
        uppercase and lowercase letter, respectively. Vowels are shuffled 
        according to vowels_permutation. The first letter in vowels_permutation 
        corresponds to a, the second to e, and so on in the order a, e, i, o, u.
        The consonants remain the same. The dictionary should have 52 
        keys of all the uppercase letters and all the lowercase letters.

        Example: When input "eaiuo":
        Mapping is a->e, e->a, i->i, o->u, u->o
        and "Hello World!" maps to "Hallu Wurld!"

        Returns: a dictionary mapping a letter (string) to 
                 another letter (string).

    def decrypt_message(self):
        '''
        Attempt to decrypt the encrypted message 
        
        Idea is to go through each permutation of the vowels and test it
        on the encrypted message. For each permutation, check how many
        words in the decrypted text are valid English words, and return
        the decrypted message with the most English words.
        
        If no good permutations are found (i.e. no permutations result in 
        at least 1 valid word), return the original string. If there are
        multiple permutations that yield the maximum number of words, return any
        one of them.

        Returns: the best decrypted message
